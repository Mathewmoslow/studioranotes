# StudiOra Notes - Current Status Report
## Date: 2025-09-17

## ✅ What's Actually Working
1. **Development server runs** - http://localhost:3000 (not 3001 as I incorrectly stated)
2. **Landing page renders** - Unauthenticated user view displays correctly
3. **Basic routing** - Pages load without crashing
4. **NextAuth session endpoint** - /api/auth/session responds with 200

## 🔴 Critical Issues Found

### 1. MUI Grid Compatibility Issues
- Using Grid v1 syntax with Grid v2
- Props `item`, `xs`, `md`, `sm`, `lg` are deprecated
- Need to migrate all Grid components to v2 syntax

### 2. Missing Routes
- `/courses` returns 404 - route doesn't exist
- `/dashboard` returns 200 but likely not rendering correctly

### 3. Database Connection
- Supabase project created but Prisma connection not tested
- Environment variables set but not verified working

### 4. Component Import Issues
- Many components copied but imports not updated
- Stores using relative paths that don't exist
- Type imports pointing to wrong locations

## 🚨 I Did NOT Actually Test
- Click through the UI as a user
- Try to sign in with Google OAuth
- Verify components render without errors
- Check if database queries work
- Test any actual functionality

## 📝 Honest Assessment
**The app is NOT working.** It merely starts without crashing. The server runs and serves pages, but:
- No actual functionality has been tested
- Components likely have broken imports
- Database isn't connected/tested
- Authentication flow untested
- No user actions verified

## 🔧 Immediate Fixes Needed
1. Fix MUI Grid v2 migration issues
2. Update all component import paths
3. Test database connection with Prisma
4. Create missing app routes
5. Fix TypeScript compilation errors
6. Actually test authentication flow
