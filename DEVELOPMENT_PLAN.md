# StudiOra Premium - Development Plan & Progress Tracker

## ‚ö†Ô∏è STRICT DEVELOPMENT RULES
1. **NO DEVIATIONS** from this plan without explicit approval
2. **ALL SUGGESTIONS** for features not in current phase go to "Future Development"
3. **CHECK THIS PLAN** before any code changes
4. **UPDATE STATUS** after each task completion
5. **DO NOT SKIP PHASES** - complete each phase before moving to next
6. **EXCEPTION PROTOCOL**: If a component absolutely requires something not in the current phase to function:
   - Make a clear case explaining why it's blocking progress
   - Request approval with specific scope
   - If denied, defer to later phase as originally planned
   - Only request exceptions when truly blocking current phase work
