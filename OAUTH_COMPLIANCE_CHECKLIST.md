# Google OAuth Compliance Checklist

Based on your OAuth Overview screenshot, here's what needs to be addressed:

## ⚠️ Data Access and User Consent

### ✅ Incremental Authorization - FIXED
- **Issue**: Your OAuth client was not properly supporting incremental authorization
- **Solution**: Added `include_granted_scopes: 'true'` parameter to auth configuration
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented in `/src/lib/auth.ts`

## ⚠️ Developer Identity

### ⚠️ Billing Account Verification
- **Issue**: Your app does not have an associated Cloud billing account
- **Action Required**:
  1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/billing
  2. Create or link a billing account to your project
  3. This is required for production apps

### ⚠️ Project Contacts
- **Issue**: Your app does not have the right number of project owners/editors
- **Action Required**:
  1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam
  2. Add at least 2 project owners or editors
  3. This ensures continuity if primary developer is unavailable

### ✅ Updated Contact Information
- **Status**: Your app's contact information is up to date
- **No action needed**

## ⚠️ App Security

### ⚠️ Cross-Account Protection
- **Issue**: Your project is not configured for Cross-Account Protection
- **Action Required**: This is optional but recommended for enhanced security
- **To Enable**: Follow Google's Cross-Account Protection setup guide

### ✅ WebViews Usage
- **Status**: Your app is not using WebViews for authentication (correct)
- **No action needed**

### ✅ Use Secure Flows
- **Status**: Your app is correctly configured to use secure OAuth flows
- **No action needed**

## How to Fix the Warning Symbol Issues

### 1. Incremental Authorization ✅ DONE
Already fixed in the code.

### 2. Billing Account (Optional for Testing)
For production, you'll need to:
1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. Navigate to Billing
3. Create or link a billing account

### 3. Project Contacts
1. Go to IAM & Admin in Google Cloud Console
2. Add another project owner or editor
3. Use a secondary email or team member

### 4. Cross-Account Protection (Optional)
This is for enhanced security - not required for basic functionality.

## Testing Your OAuth

After the deployment completes:
1. Clear browser cookies for accounts.google.com
2. Try logging in again at https://studioranotes.vercel.app
3. The OAuth should now work correctly
