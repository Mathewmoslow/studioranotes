## 📊 Phase 1 Progress Summary

| Section | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **1.1 Project Structure** | 85% | Missing apps/api setup only |
| **1.2 Authentication** | 60% | Needs database for user profiles |
| **1.3 Core Infrastructure** | 70% | Database connection pending |
| **1.4 Component Migration** | 85% | All components migrated and fixed |
| **1.5 Shared Component Library** | 60% | Core components created |
| **1.6 State Management** | 100% ✅ | Fully completed |
| **1.7 Development Environment** | 65% | Missing git hooks & CI/CD |

**Overall Phase 1:** ~80% Complete

## 🚧 Remaining Blockers

1. **Database Connection** - Need correct Supabase credentials from dashboard
   - Login to Supabase with GitHub
   - Go to project settings → Database
   - Copy connection strings (pooled & direct)

2. **Google OAuth Setup** - Need credentials from Google Cloud Console
   - Required for authentication to work

3. **Missing Routes** - Need to create:
   - `/courses`
   - `/schedule`
   - `/notes`

## 🎯 Next Steps (To Complete Phase 1)

1. **Get Supabase credentials** and update .env files
2. **Test database connection** with `npx prisma db push`
3. **Create missing app routes**
4. **Set up Google OAuth** credentials
5. **Test authentication flow**
6. **Create git hooks** with Husky (optional)
7. **Set up GitHub Actions** CI/CD (optional)

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **Reality vs Assumptions** - Actually tested the app instead of assuming it works
2. **MUI v7 Breaking Changes** - Grid component completely rewritten
3. **Import Path Management** - Monorepo requires careful package references
4. **Supabase Connection** - Needs specific pooler URLs for Prisma

## 📝 Notes for Tomorrow

- Phase 1 is nearly complete (~80%)
- Main blocker is database credentials
- Once database connected, can test auth flow
- Ready to start Phase 2 (Canvas Integration) after database is working
- Development server is stable and running at http://localhost:3000

## 🚀 Application Status

**Server:** Running ✅
**Landing Page:** Renders correctly ✅
**TypeScript:** Compiles with no critical errors ✅
**Database:** Not connected ❌
**Authentication:** Not tested ❌
**Core Features:** Not accessible yet ❌

The foundation is solid but needs database connection to proceed with testing actual functionality.
